# Chromatic-Polynomial

A graph colouring is a colouring of a graphs vertices so that no adjacent vertices have the same colour

A basic GUI that allows users to create a graph and compute the Chromatic Polynomial of a Graph of up to 10 vertices.
The chromatic polynomial of a graph gives us the number of ways to colour the graph given k colours.
It also computes the minimum number of colours required to colour the graph G, usually denoted X(G), said as: 'Chi' of G.
The code used to calculate Chromatic polynomial uses a Contraction algorithm. Recursion used in implementation, so poor efficiency.
