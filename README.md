A basic GUI that allows users to create a graph and compute the Chromatic Polynomial of a Graph of up to 10 vertices.<br>
The Chromatic polynomial of a graph gives us the number of ways to colour the graph given k different colours.<br>
It also computes the minimum number of colours required to colour the graph G, usually denoted X(G), said as: 'Chi' of G.<br>
A graph colouring is a colouring of a graphs vertices so that no adjacent vertices have the same colour, visit 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring for more info.
The code used to calculate Chromatic polynomial uses a Deletion - Contraction algorithm. 
Due to recursion used in implementation, the program is quite slow to calculate result.
